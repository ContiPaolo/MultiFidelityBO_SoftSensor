In Proceedings of the 14th IFAC Symposium on Dynamics and Control of Process Systems, including Biosystems – DYCOPS 2025.

The repository contains code to run the first example of the paper (download the repo, run the outer loop in matlab, it will call python for the inner loop which relies on the progressive_network).
The appendix to the paper is also available here.
